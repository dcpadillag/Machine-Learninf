# Machine-Learning (Building)
Small projects to learn a little about Machine Learning.
## General Objectives
1. Learn several tools of Machine Learning.
2. Use Machine Learning techniques for some simple problems in condensed matter physics
## Contents
1. References about machine learning technics applied in condensed matter (topological insulators, phase transitions,...)
2. Introductory example for supervised learning.
3. Slides about machine learning topics
4. Supervised learning projects (phase transition in Ising model, convolutional neural network with tensorflow,...)
